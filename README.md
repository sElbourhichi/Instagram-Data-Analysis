# Instagram-Data-Analysis
Answering different questions using SQL 

this project is a cloned mimic version of Instagram database. the goal of this project is to perform data analysis to answer question and scenarios such as : 
- finding the 5 oldest users.
- finding the day of the week do most users register on to schedule an ad campgain.
- finding the users who have never posted to target the inactive ones with an email campaign.

to realize that, I have used Python to generate some random data, and I have used the SGBD SQL Server.
