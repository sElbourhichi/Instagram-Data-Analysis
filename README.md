# Instagram-Data-Analysis
Answering different questions using SQL. 

This project is a cloned mimic version of Instagram database. The goal of this project is to perform data analysis to answer question and scenarios such as : 
- Finding the oldest users.
- Finding the day of the week do most users register on to schedule an ad campgain.
- Finding the users who have never posted to target the inactive ones with an email campaign.
- Etc...

To do so, I have used Python to generate some random data, and I have used SQL Server for DBMS.
